# The Influence of Socio-Economic Status and Information Access on Innovation Adoption Among Farmers in Southwest Nigeria
📖 Overview

This project explores how socio-economic status (SES) and access to information affect the adoption of agricultural innovations among farmers in Southwest Nigeria. Using survey data from 400 farmers across six states, I applied descriptive and inferential statistics to identify the most significant drivers of adoption.

The findings highlight that while socio-economic status and demographic factors (age, gender, education) had limited effects, access to agricultural information emerged as the strongest predictor of adoption. Farmers with low information access were 57% less likely to adopt new practices compared to those with better access.

📊 Methods and Analysis

Data Collection: Structured questionnaire (400 farmers across Ekiti, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, and Oyo states).

Data Analysis Tool: SPSS v27.

Descriptive Statistics: Frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations.

Inferential Statistics:

Ordinal Logistic Regression (DV: Innovation Adoption; IVs: SES, Information Access).

Regression Model:

Logit (p) = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1(SES) + 𝛽2(Information Access) + 𝛽3(Demographic) + 𝜖
Where p is the propability of Adoption

📌 Key Findings

Majority of farmers: Moderate SES, but Low Information Access.

Adoption of innovations: Low overall.

Information Access → Strongest predictor of adoption (B = –0.836, Exp(B) = 0.433, p < 0.01).

SES and demographics → Not statistically significant.

💡 Recommendations

Strengthen agricultural extension services.

Promote digital platforms for information sharing.

Support farmer groups and cooperatives as community-based knowledge hubs.

Integrate information access into agricultural policy as a key factor for innovation adoption.
